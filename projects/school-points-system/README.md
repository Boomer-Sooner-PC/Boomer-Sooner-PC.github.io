## About

This is a project I built for a teacher a few years ago to easily be able to give points to students given the period and desk they sit at. It was mainly a way for me to learn nodejs, html, and css.

It has a student portal where student can select their class period and see how many points they have. It also has a teacher portal which requires a password. In that portal the teacher can give and take points as well as edit names for each class period.

## Running

1. run `npm install`
2. run `node .`
