## About

This is my personal website designed to be hosted on github pages. It is built using Gatsby so I can learn React. It also hosts some projects I have that are not built using Gatsby, but are still moved to the build directory.

## How to set up

-   have node.js installed
-   have python installed
-   have gatsby.js installed

1. cd into the /src folder and run `npm install -i`
2. cd back into the parent directory
3. run `compile.py`
