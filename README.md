# Personal Website Project

## About

This is my personal website designed to be hosted on GitHub pages. It is built using React.

## How to set up

-   have node.js installed
-   have python installed

1. cd into the /src folder and run `npm install -i`
2. cd back into the main directory
3. then run `python compile.py`

## Deployment

T~~his GitHub repo has 2 branches (main and gh-pages). I push all the code to the main branch so it can be viewed here. I push just the code from the build directory to the gh-pages using the command: `git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages`. I have switched the branch GitHub pages deploys from to the gh-pages branch.~~

I have switched to the site being hosted from the ./docs folder. This was done because deploying every time became a big pain.
